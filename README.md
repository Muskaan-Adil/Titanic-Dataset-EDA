# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to analyze and visualize the key features of the dataset, such as the distribution of passenger attributes, survival rates, and the relationships between various variables.

## Key Features:
- Data cleaning and inspection
- Visualizations of numerical and categorical data
- Identification of missing values
- Correlation analysis between numerical features
- Insights into survival rates based on passenger characteristics (e.g., age, class, gender)

## Dataset Information:
- **Source**: Titanic dataset from (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JXtphvxwmiGoAopn2uReXsJMTQAZgrfG/view)
- **Columns**:
  - PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
